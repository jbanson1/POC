# Memory Streams

From my brief understanding memory streams are used for temporary quick storage for data that is to be used
immediately. It transforms large data into binary groups enabling the data to be stored incrementally.

The main advantage is it is efficient and fast.

offset - used to locate the element stored on the stream.

Encoding - Converting UniCode Characters to a block of bytes.
